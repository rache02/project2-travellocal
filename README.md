# project2-travellocal

The project was to produce a full stacked app with at least two models, user functionality, restful routes and utilised SQL (interacting with stored data). Although I believe all this was achieved there is still a lot of room for improvement.

The original concept of this app was to connect travellers with locals of their destination, providing insights into the best aspects of daily life and events that may not be as publicised.

Areas of Improvement
- Both user and event databases were established and can be accessed, however their effect on each other kept failing and had to be removed to upload
- Comments and Reviews would only apply to one user when they need to apply to two
- Need to have clearer ERD as lost understanding of direction at some points
- CSS needs to be done properly
